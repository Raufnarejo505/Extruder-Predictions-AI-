# Branch: feature/predictive-baseline-dashboard

## Purpose
Feature development branch for implementing a Predictive Monitoring Dashboard with machine/material-based baselines, baseline learning mode, derived KPIs, and explainable risk indicators.

## Scope of Changes
- Predictive Monitoring Dashboard
- Machine + Material based baselines
- Baseline learning mode
- Derived KPIs (avg temperature, temperature spread, stability)
- Risk calculation logic (green / yellow / red)
- Explainable metrics and UI indicators

**Note:** No behavior changes yet – feature development branch. Existing OPC-UA ingestion, anomaly detection, and alarm code remain untouched.
